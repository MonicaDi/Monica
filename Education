  ** Summary:
The meeting began with each participant introducing themselves. Wei encouraged everyone to dive directly
into areas of interest in the Education field without worrying about market segmentation (e.g., using ChatGPT
for literature summarization or converting text content into short videos). As an NPO, we aim to provide
services for researchers, students, and educators, using Paper GPT to automatically transform long papers
or research content into concise visual video presentations (under 3-4 minutes). We also discussed integrating
these videos with platforms like WeChat and Facebook for interaction. Monica will prepare a product design plan
by Sunday evening. Before our next meeting, everyone will provide their feedback.
